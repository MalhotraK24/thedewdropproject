      "text": "Choosing The Dewdrop Project for our marriage was one of the best decision that we took! The entire team covered all our functions so beautifully that my entire family is in love with the photos and videos shared.  Their presence at our functions was so delightful and entertaining, to the level that they were involved in our functions as well.  I would also give big thumbs up to Inushi, who acted like my second bridesmaid during the wedding.  I can‚Äôt thank you guys enough in capturing the most important days of our lives so beautifully.  Much love to the entire team!  P.s - we fall in love with the pre-wedding and wedding highlights every day ‚ù§Ô∏è  Xoxo"

They have moved away from the conventional way of posing for pictures and they try to make the pictures as natural as possible.       The candid photography Inushi does is the highlight. The video they compiled is simply AMAZING. It shows how much thought and effort has gone in coming up with something like that. Wish you guys all the best and we will see you guys at the re-shoot for our 10th anniversary. Much love to all of you. IshRa"

      "text": "Pinning down my experience with The Dewdrop Project would be difficult as words would definitely fall short once I start praising Inushi and her team for the way they shot my wedding.      There‚Äôs no one, LITERALLY NO ONE better than them to cover a story of two individuals and their big days. Inushi stood with me as a friend, sister, photographer. She was a part of the family and made sure each moment was captured beautifully!! She helped me choose my venue, made corrections during the events so that everything captured perfectly, spoke to me well in advance about the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts in order to avoid any glitches, was completely transparent about the number of team members joining in and made sure nothing was left out and each memory could be relived through her pictures. I‚Äôm glad I chose perfection! Her management, her team and the work ethic, EVERYTHING was spot on. I would say this again and forever - I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for someone better to cover my life‚Äôs 3 most special days."

      "text": "We are very thankful to Team Dewdrop for helping us treasure our most special event with superb pictures and videos. They managed to capture every moment that many a times we didn't realize even happened. We are especially impressed with their candid photography and would like to give a big thumbs up for it. Our favourite pictures from the album are the ones we didn't know were getting captured - truly worth being adorned by the walls of our home. All through the function, we never had to make a single phone call to chase them up to the venue which makes them extremely dependable. I'd like to make a special mention of the GIF invitation that they created for us  - very fresh and quirky, we absolutely loved it (and I guess so did everyone who received it). Wish  you guys all the best and always two hands full of lovely shoots ! Cheers,Nikhil and Disha"

AMAZING is the word for them. They really are more than photographers. From the beginning through to the end they were supportive and so easy to be with and it was like having friends there with you yet being so professional and experienced. We are going to cherish the memories that they have captured so beautifully, forever."

Inushi was the only photographer that I met and I booked her in the first meeting itself. :) It was a treat having her around during my most special but hugely stressful day! She was there at the time I was dressing up and got my hair done exactly how it looked good in the pictures! She is a photographer-cum-bridesmaid for a bride on her big day - whether it's assisting you with makeup touch-ups or helping you with uncomfy outfits - she can do it all! One week to my engagement and I have received most of the pictures! Everyone in my family is loving the pictures!! <3 Thank you Inushi for making it so special!"
