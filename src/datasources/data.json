The photographer worked really well during the event to capture each moment! The promo video was the best product delivered by them! If you get a chance to look at the video .. their work speaks for them!"

AMAZING is the word for them. They really are more than photographers. From the beginning through to the end they were supportive and so easy to be with and it was like having friends there with you yet being so professional and experienced. We are going to cherish the memories that they have captured so beautifully, forever."

They have moved away from the conventional way of posing for pictures and they try to make the pictures as natural as possible.       The candid photography Inushi does is the highlight. The video they compiled is simply AMAZING. It shows how much thought and effort has gone in coming up with something like that. Wish you guys all the best and we will see you guys at the re-shoot for our 10th anniversary. Much love to all of you. IshRa"

Inushi stood with me as a friend, sister and a photographer. She helped me choose the venue, made corrections during the events so that everything was captured perfectly, shared with me the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts in order to avoid any glitches and and made sure nothing was left out. I‚Äôm glad I chose perfection! Her management and the work ethic of the team, EVERYTHING was spot on. I would say this again and forever - I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for someone better to cover my life‚Äôs 3 most special days."

They managed to capture every moment that many a times we didn't realize even happened. We are especially impressed with their candid photography and would like to give a big thumbs up for it. Our favourite pictures from the album are the ones we didn't know were getting captured - truly worth being adorned by the walls of our home. All through the function, we never had to make a single phone call to chase them up to the venue which makes them extremely dependable. I'd like to make a special mention of the GIF invitation that they created for us  - very fresh and quirky, we absolutely loved it (and I guess so did everyone who received it). Wish  you guys all the best and always two hands full of lovely shoots ! Cheers,Nikhil and Disha"

Inushi was the only photographer that I met and I booked her in the first meeting itself. :) It was a treat having her around during my most special but hugely stressful day! She was there at the time I was dressing up and got my hair done exactly how it looked good in the pictures! She is a photographer-cum-bridesmaid for a bride on her big day - whether it's assisting you with makeup touch-ups or helping you with uncomfy outfits - she can do it all! One week to my engagement and I have received most of the pictures! Everyone in my family is loving the pictures!! <3 Thank you Inushi for making it so special!"
